# Snake AI

**Update:** This repo has been archived. It was meant for testing purpose. I am working on an project which will deploy nearly all possible techniques to play the Snakes game. Stay tuned for more updates.

A fun project to learn different techniques to solving (playing) the Snake Game.
The code is not yet ready and may not be readable as I am still learning it is meant for my understanding.
Nevertheless you are free to have a look.
